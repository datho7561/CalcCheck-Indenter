# Monokai CalcCheck 
The Monokai theme ported to [CalcCheckWeb](http://calccheck.mcmaster.ca/CalcCheckDoc/)

Monokai was originally a theme for [TextMate](https://github.com/textmate/textmate) but has now been ported to many other editors.

Heavily based off (I started this project from the source code of) [Caleb's](https://github.com/calebmech) [CalcCheck Indenter](https://github.com/calebmech/CalcCheck-Indenter).
